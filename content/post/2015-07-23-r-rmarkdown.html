<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>In capitalist countries, popular satisfaction with the federal government often determines whether it wins elections.In this paper we explore the 2019 CES dataset,which was a non-probability survey<strong><sup>1</sup></strong> conducted in the lead-up to the 2019 Federal Election. We found that people’’s education level is closely related to their satisfaction with the federal government.Our findings have certain reference value to the governing party’s re-election.</p>
